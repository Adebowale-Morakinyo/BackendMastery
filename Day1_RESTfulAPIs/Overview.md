## RESTful APIs.

### Overview:
RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) are a set of architectural principles for designing networked applications. They rely on a stateless communication model where each request from a client contains all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. REST is not a technology but a set of constraints and principles for building web services.

### Significance:
RESTful APIs are crucial in modern web development for creating scalable and maintainable systems. They provide a standard way for different systems to communicate over HTTP. The stateless nature makes them highly scalable as each request is independent, and they are easy to understand, implement, and maintain.
